## ADT302 - Democratize Data Preparation for Analytics & Machine Learning: A Hands-On Lab
Machine learning (ML) outcomes are only as good as the data they are built upon. Preparing data for ML is time consuming and cumbersome; “data wrangling” for analytics can consume over 80% of project effort. ML Wrangling Assistant, based on Trifacta running on AWS, streamlines ML applications so teams can focus on the work that matters—creating accurate predictions that improve products, services, and organizational efficiency. In this lab, we cover one of two data preparation use cases. Marketing Analytics analyzes web ads by cleaning and transforming ecommerce transactions in a relational table combined to a clickstream semi-structured log file. Cross-Sell Analytics explores, structures, standardizes, and combines multiple file types (CSV, JSON, Excel) to create a single, consistent view of customers. Final outputs are the categorical features and attributes to train, test, and validate the data sets required by Amazon SageMaker to perform ML modeling.

## AIM311 - Machine Learning and Predictive Quality Management
From refined products to heavy crude, Four-Path Ultrasonic Flow Meters offers the capability to minimize measurement uncertainty of liquid hydrocarbons. Attendees work to build a machine learning (ML) predictive quality management (PQM) solution on AWS to proactively predict the health of the ultrasonic flow meters. This is done using the ML Data Readiness Package based on KNIME, from AWS Marketplace. Another PQM example for attendees to explore uses features extracted from motor current measured with a current probe and an oscilloscope on two phases measured under different speeds, load moments, and load forces. ML is used to proactively classify whether the motor has intact or defective components. A third PQM example involves using raw process sensor data from a hydraulic test rig with a primary working and a secondary cooling-filtration circuit, connected via the oil tank. They then use ML on AWS to proactively predict the cooler condition, hydraulic accumulator condition, internal pump leakage condition, and valve condition.
